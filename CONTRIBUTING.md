* **Submitting Pull Requests:** If you want to contribute code (bug fixes, new features, improvements):
    1.  Fork the repository.
    2.  Create a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-number`).
    3.  Make your changes, adhering to the coding standards.
    4.  Add tests for your changes if applicable.
    5.  Ensure your code compiles and integrates correctly with VLC.
    6.  Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.
